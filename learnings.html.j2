    <h1>Flip7 Strategic Analysis</h1>

    <div class="insight-box">
        <h2>1. Expected Value and the 'Sweet Spot'</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Average Score</strong> curve exhibits a smooth, concave profile, reaching its zenith in the 
            <strong>X = 25–30</strong> range. This represents the optimal strategic threshold for maximizing long-term 
            expected value, where the marginal utility of additional points is perfectly balanced against the escalating risk of a bust.
        </p>

        <h2>2. The Median Phase Transition</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Median Score</strong> demonstrates a linear relationship (y ≈ x) with the strategy threshold until 
            approximately <strong>X = 35</strong>. At this critical juncture, the cumulative probability of busting crosses 
            the 50% threshold, causing the median to collapse abruptly to zero. This indicates a sharp phase transition 
            from "likely scoring" to "likely busting."

        <h2>3. Distribution Dynamics</h2>
        <p>
            The histograms reveal a classic risk-reward trade-off: as X increases, the distribution shifts toward higher 
            values at the cost of a significantly heavier weight at zero. Notably, the non-bust distribution tends to 
            cluster tightly just above the threshold X, suggesting minimal "overshoot" once the standing condition is met.
        </p>

        <h2>4. The 'Flip 7' Long Tail</h2>
        <p>
            A distinct "long tail" persists around the <strong>60-point mark</strong>. This represents the 
            <strong>Flip 7 bonus</strong> scenario (successfully drawing 7 cards). While this occurs in only ~1% of 
            trials at low X, its frequency increases to roughly 10% as X approaches infinity. In high-threshold 
            strategies, this "Flip 7" path becomes the primary—and eventually only—surviving non-zero component of 
            the distribution.
